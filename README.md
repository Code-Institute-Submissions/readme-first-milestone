<h1 align="center">First Milestone Project</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://linaewen88.github.io/first-milestone/)

This is my First Milestone Project. I created a website for virtual team-building experience company. It is designed to show the different existing experiences and to explain the value of such activities to the visitors of the website.

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the company.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to introduce the team to the visitors, and I want to share their social media links to see their followings on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find information about the different experiences.
        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find out about the history of this company, and where their idea came from.
        3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to discover what a team-building is and why did is important.

    -   #### Frequent User Goals
        1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added experiences or team experiences.
        2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if someone new joined the team.
        3. As a Frequent User, I want to see added content into the About us page.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are white, and yellow.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Droid Serif font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. I also wanted it to gave people the feeling of working from home, digital experience, and I added the pictures within the carousel to add the experiences and fun part.

        3. Now the user has the option to know by checking the experience page a little bit further down.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
        2. At the bottom of the first 3 pages there is a redirection call to action to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.
        3. On the ABOUT US, a clear description of the company history is given. 

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to get to know the members of the team better, to familiziare with them. 
        1. Once the new visitor has read the About Us, they will get to know the team better.
        2. The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
        3. In the Team page, the visitors are easily able to check the social medias of the creators and funders of the company.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on several browsers, such as Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs

-   In the carousel, the title of the experiences don't appear at the same exact height. I also had to hide it in the mobile version of the pages, as the text wasn't showing in a proper way.
-   The "Tell me More" redirect visitors to the "About us" page. I couldn't create something more advanced, as Javascript was not to be used in this project. 
-   The logo is small. Unfortantely that is the only one I had, and its definition is not really high.
